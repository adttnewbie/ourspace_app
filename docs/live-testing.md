# Live Testing Checklist

Use this before building the next feature phase.

## Setup

1. Update the Apps Script project with every file from `apps-script/`.
2. In Apps Script, run `setupSchema` once if sheets are not created yet.
   Run it again after any schema change, for example after adding `date_plans` or `gallery`.
3. Confirm Script Properties are configured:
   - `SHEET_ID`
   - `SESSION_SECRET`
   - `PAIRING_WINDOW_SECONDS`
   - `DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID`
4. In Apps Script editor, run `authorizeOurSpace` once and approve Google Drive access.
   Expect it to return `status: authorized` and the Drive root folder name.
5. Deploy Apps Script with a new Web App version:
   - Deploy > Manage deployments
   - Edit the Web App deployment
   - Version: New version
   - Deploy
6. Copy the Web App `/exec` URL into `.env` as `APPS_SCRIPT_URL`.
7. Keep frontend calls on the proxy:

```bash
VITE_API_URL="/api/apps-script"
APPS_SCRIPT_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxx/exec"
```

8. Run proxy-capable local dev:

```bash
vercel dev
```

`bun dev` has a Vite fallback proxy in this repo, but `vercel dev` is the closer production check for `/api/apps-script`.

## Backup Setup

1. Run `setupSchema()`.
2. Confirm `DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID` points to the private OurSpace Drive folder.
3. Run `authorizeOurSpace()`.
4. Run `backup.health` from Settings with `Cek Backup`.
5. Run `runBackup()` manually from Apps Script editor.
6. Confirm a JSON file appears in Drive folder `backups`.
7. Confirm the `backups` sheet has a `success` row.
8. Open the JSON file and confirm `generatedAt`, `includedSheets`, and `itemCounts` exist.
9. Confirm the expected sheets exist and the item counts look right.
10. Search the JSON for `sessionToken` and confirm no raw token is present.
11. Confirm gallery data is metadata only, not original image base64.
12. Run `installBackupTrigger()`.
13. In Apps Script Triggers, confirm a daily `runBackup` trigger exists.

## Settings Checks

1. Open Settings.
2. Confirm API path shows `/api/apps-script`.
3. Click `Cek koneksi`.
4. Expect `Backend tersambung.`
5. Click `Cek session`.
6. If no local session exists, expect `UNAUTHORIZED`.
7. Click `Cek Gallery` after pairing.
8. Click `Cek Backup` after pairing.
9. Expect `Gallery siap dipakai.` and `Backup siap dipakai.`
10. Use `Hapus session lokal` to reset the browser back to `/pairing`.

## Local API Smoke Test

Run these while `vercel dev` or `bun dev` is serving the proxy:

```bash
curl --max-time 10 -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps-script \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8' \
  --data '{"action":"health.check","memberId":"","sessionToken":"","payload":{}}'
```

Expected: fast JSON with `ok: true`.

```bash
curl --max-time 10 -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps-script \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8' \
  --data '{"action":"session.resume","memberId":"","sessionToken":"","payload":{}}'
```

Expected: fast JSON with `ok: false` and error code `SESSION_INVALID`.

## Pairing

1. Open `/pairing` on the first browser or device.
2. Enter nickname.
3. Hold the pairing button.
4. Expect first device to enter waiting state.
5. Open `/pairing` on the second browser or device.
6. Enter a different nickname.
7. Hold the pairing button.
8. Expect both devices to redirect to Home.
9. Confirm `anniversaryDate` is created once.
10. Restart the dev server.
11. Refresh both browsers and expect Home through `session.resume`.
12. Call `pairing.start` after the couple exists and expect `COUPLE_ALREADY_PAIRED`.

Pairing is one-time only because it represents the anniversary event.

## Session Recovery

1. Clear local storage on a third browser/device.
2. Open `/pairing`.
3. Expect recovery flow, not hold-button pairing.
4. Enter the right nickname with a wrong anniversary date.
5. Expect generic recovery failure copy.
6. Enter the right nickname and correct anniversary date.
7. Expect a new session token to be issued and saved, then redirect to Home.
8. Confirm `anniversaryDate` did not change in `couple_settings`.
9. Confirm expired rows in `pairing_sessions` do not affect `session.resume`.

Recovery currently replaces the `sessionToken` for that member/device identity.
Full multi-device approval can be added later if needed.

## Home

1. Confirm Home loads greeting from backend.
2. Confirm days together appears.

## Final Mobile QA

Run this on a narrow phone viewport or real mobile browser.

1. Pairing: nickname step is compact, hold screen is clear, waiting/expired/error copy is short and understandable.
2. Home: greeting and days-together card is the emotional center, shortcuts show Notes, Dates, Gallery, and Lists.
3. Notes: create, edit, delete, validation, color picker, and note cards are readable without cramped buttons.
4. Dates: List CRUD still works, Kalender month navigation works, selected day is obvious, selected-day details stay compact.
5. Gallery: upload form explains file limits, preview or placeholder looks intentional, caption/date/edit/delete are readable.
6. Shared Lists: filters are compact, category/status chips include text, create/edit/delete are easy to tap.
7. Backup: Settings `Cek Backup` and `Backup sekarang` show loading and success/error states clearly.
8. Settings: API/session/gallery/debug sections are readable, and `Hapus session lokal` is visually careful before reset.
9. Bottom nav: no page content or primary button is hidden behind the nav at the bottom.
10. Accessibility: every form has visible or accessible labels, focus rings are visible, and status is not color-only.

## Network Check

Browser Network tab should show:

```text
POST /api/apps-script
```

It should not show:

```text
POST https://script.google.com/...
```
